kawala uses Apache Ivy for dependency management, so first bootstrap ivy:

  $ ant ivy-init

Then build kawala:

  $ ant

To integrate with Eclipse please: 

  * Install the IvyDE plugin from http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde.
  * Right-click on ivy.xml and choose "Add Ivy Library..." which will configure the classpath.
